## Hello, I'm HippoProgrammer
I'm a CS student who codes far too many stupid things.

### My current projects
* Submitting pull requests to @SuitablyMysterious 's repos whether they like it or not (HippoProgrammer/gameJam-trappedOnThMoon)
* Flask web app that interfaces with the Discord API to provide OAuth2 signin to my Discord server (HippoProgrammer3/testing-flask)
* 3D version of my Godot game, Super Forklift (https://itch.io/hippogamebuilder)
* Building a python hash library that is utterly terrible (HippoProgrammer3/python-hash)

### My past projects
* My first Godot game, Super Forklift (in collaboration with @DrygiththeGM)
* Making a 3D printer play chess (@Hacking3DPrinters)
* Setting up PiHole on two synced Raspberry Pis
* Running Kodi with a TV aerial on a Raspberry Pi
* Creating a fake departure board on an e-ink display on a Raspberry Pi
* Locally hosting Moodle on a Raspberry Pi
* Rewriting the Flask-Ask GitHub repo to work with modern dependencies
* Rewriting MultiWFN from ifort to gfortran (then learning other people have done it already)
* Various other projects

### How to contact me
Don't. (unless you know me IRL, in which case you know how to)
